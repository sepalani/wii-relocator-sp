# Wii Relocator SP

WiiRelocatorSP gives you different ways to read a relocation file such as
**REL**, **RSO**, **SEL** files. You can also extract the function in binary
format, this way you'll be able to disassemble through objdump.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/sepalani/wii-relocator-sp/wiki) for further
details.
